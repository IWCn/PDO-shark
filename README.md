PDO-shark
=========

Advanced chimpu framework with enhanced and easier pdo class and form validations


For using file system just create a file in views and a controller for that file must be created with same name
for ex : protected/views/fronetnd/login.php then controller for this must be protected/controller/frontend/login_controller.php

Autoloading of class is done so all classes must be named with a underscore class
Refer to library folder inside protected


For views and controller folders

Controller : protected / controller / backend or frontend

Views : protected / views / backend or frontend


For design

root folder / assets / backend or frontend / css : js : img folders respectively
